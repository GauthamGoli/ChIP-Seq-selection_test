### Installing PeakSegFPOP

 * Installing PeakSegFPOP is straightforward. I just followed the instructions and was able to get it installed.


### Running PeakSegFPOP


```
$ Rscript test_demo.R
```

```
$ Rscript pipeline.R ./test/demo/
```

I executed the above commands and was able to view the results which were generated in ```./test/demo``` directory.  The results were the **same results** as shown on [http://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~thocking/PeakSegFPOP-input-data/ ](http://cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~thocking/PeakSegFPOP-input-data/)

The generated results are also available in this repository.

The next part of the test was to study the PR of Toby.
